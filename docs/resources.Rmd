"Some software for geostatistical analysis uses an empirical variogram to fit the parameters of the correlation function. However, this option does not make any assumptions about a likelihood function for the data or uses a multivariate Gaussian distribution for the spatially structured random effect. A good description of these techniques is available in Cressie (1993)."

  * See the function `mcmcse::minESS`

# Survey weights

* [Design Effects and Effective Sample Size](https://docs.displayr.com/wiki/Design_Effects_and_Effective_Sample_Size)

## Non-integer pseduo-likelihoods

* Non-integer counts due to the use of survey weights. Could use `round` but this is an unsatisfying solution
* In `stan` and `TMB` a custom continuous version of the likelihood could be implemented
* In `R-INLA` there are `xbinomial` and `xpoisson` functions for non-integer counts
    * Be warned that these may make the marginal likelihood not interpretable as it is not clear what to do with the normalising constant
* Keywords to investigate
    * Bayesian pseudo likelihood
